[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cbgoodman/cgoodman_hugo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cbgoodman/cgoodman_hugo)

This is the code and much of the content for my website, http://www.cgoodman.com. The present version uses the [Kube CSS framework](http://imperavi.com/kube/), takes advantage of a site design by [Greg Restall](http://consequently.org) and [Kieran Healy](http://kieranhealy.org/), and requires Hugo version 0.52 or higher.
