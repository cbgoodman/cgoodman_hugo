This study examines the interaction effect between tax and expenditure limitations (TELs) and jurisdictional overlap (overlapping local governments per municipality) on per capita own source revenues for US county areas. Previous literature suggests that vertical stacking of local government creates the conditions for a commons issue. These relatively uncoordinated local governments have little incentive to pay attention to the cumulative effect they have on tax burden, and this may drive up local revenue generate to inefficiently high levels (“overfishing” the fiscal common pool). An important wrinkle in this is the potential for this relationship to be driven by TELs. If local governments are using special districts as a mechanism to circumvent TELs (who are often not subject to the limitations), this potential relationship between jurisdictional overlap and own source revenues may be spurious.

This potential relationship is examined using Census of Governments data from 1972 to 2017 at the county area level. An empirical model is built examining per capita own source revenues from all local governments as a function jurisdictional overlap, potentially binding TELs, and the interaction of the two. This model has two aims. First, to replicate the previous findings in the literature and second to re-examine this relationship in light of TELs. If special districts are indeed being used to circumvent TELs, we should expect the relationship between jurisdictional overlap and per capita own source revenue to no longer be statistically significant. This analysis should be of interest to academics and policymakers alike as the potential for circumvention of TELs and other restrictions on general purpose local government autonomy by the creation of special districts is an important and contested question. This issue has important ramifications for democratic accountability as well as the efficacy of state imposed fiscal restrictions.
