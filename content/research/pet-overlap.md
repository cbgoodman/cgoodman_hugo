Punctuated Equilibrium Theory (PET) examines how institutional structures and organizational factors can impede information flows, slowing policy change. When change does occur, it over-reacts (punctuation) after years of under-reacting (incremental). What remains understudied in the literature is how information processing can be affected by the presence of multiple governments. Across the US, there has been an increase in the number of local governments and special districts. We posit that increased government overlap will lead to increased budgetary volatility. We test our theory using the Fiscally Standardized Cities (FiSC) database. These data are uniquely positioned to examine these phenomena since data on the finances of local governments are “standardized” within the boundaries of a single (typically) central city. This arrangement allows us to examine the effects of changes in the composition of the city-level intergovernmental system (the addition or subtraction of overlapping governments) on budgetary changes at the system level.
