After analyzing forty years special district data, this study finds that the dissolution of special districts, “exits” in U.S. counties are unrelated to demand factors (XXX), such as new service provision. Using fixed effects regression specified at the all county and urban county levels, we find that restrictions of fiscal autonomy of cities are associated with both increases and decreases in the special district exit rate. This also suggests there is likely clever avoidance of general purpose governments to issue new debt.  The findings are consistent with the circumvention argument, made in the local autonomy literature, albeit from a different perspective.
