The nonprofit sector aims to provide services with a public benefit, but how honest are they? Since the nonprofit sector relies on fundraising efforts to support its administration and program costs, and since poor financial performance can scare potential contributors away, nonprofit organizations have an incentive to appear fiscally healthy regardless of their true condition. We examine the honesty of organizations in the nonprofit sector using Benford's Law, which tests for abnormalities in data that result from intentional falsification. Using the 990 tax filings for 53,654 nonprofits in the United States from 2012 and 2013, we find evidence of problems in the accuracy of their financial reporting. These misrepresentations support the hypothesis that nonprofits reporting on their fiscal health is frequently less than fully honest.
