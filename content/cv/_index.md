<p><br />I am Assistant Professor of <a href="http://mpa.niu.edu/">Public Administration</a> at <a href="http://www.niu.edu">Northern Illinois University</a>. Much of my research exists at the nexus of local public finance, local government management, urban policy, and intergovernmental affairs. My research agenda, in large part, seeks to examine questions of why local areas make the governance decisions they do. As with most research in this realm, these decisions are inextricably linked to issues of public spending, taxation, and state policy. I tend to focus on specific questions dealing with the special district form of local government as these governments are under-researched in the relevant literature.</p>

<p>I received a B.S. in political science from Kennesaw State University, a Master of Public Administration with a specialization in public policy analysis from the University of Georgia, and a PhD in public administration and policy from the University of Georgia.</p>

<p>Most of my <a href="publications/">publications and working papers</a> are available on this site, along with my <a href="blog/">random musings</a>. My complete <a href="vita.pdf">curriculum vitae</a> has more detail, if you need it.</p>
