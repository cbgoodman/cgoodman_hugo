This course is designed to introduce students to both seminal theoretical works, and contemporary debates,
around these fundamental questions of urban growth and change. Although our focus is on the “economic,”
our disciplinary scope will be relatively broad, encompassing scholarship in economics, geography, urban
planning, and urban sociology. While this course is not an urban economics course *per se*, it is assumed that
you have at least some rudimentary knowledge of microeconomic concepts; if not, you will likely need to
backfill some of this along the way.
