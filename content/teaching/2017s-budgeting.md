This course introduces students to the theory and practice of budgeting at all levels of government and in
the nonprofit sector. Particular emphasis is given to budgeting in local government because of its historical
role as an incubator for budget innovations and its accessibility to citizens. Additionally, nonprofit
budgeting is emphasized because of the increasing role of nonprofits in public service delivery. This course
equips students with competence in the use of budgeting terminology, innovations in budget preparation,
the linkage of the budget to the accounting and financial reporting systems, and the role of technology in
shaping budget preparation and administrative implementation.
