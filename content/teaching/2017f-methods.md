Decision-making supported by quantitative analysis is becoming increasingly important in the public and nonprofit sectors. As a result, managers are expected to be fluent in quantitative analytical skills. This course is a graduate level, introductory statistics and research methodology course. It will focus on applied quantitative analysis for public/nonprofit management and policy. The goal of the course is two-fold: (1) to train you to apply the concepts presented and use them to inform real world decision-making in the public and nonprofit sectors and (2) to prepare you to successfully complete your capstone project.
