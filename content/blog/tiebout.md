There is a significant disagreement in the profession on the pronunciation of the name of a prominent figure, Charles Tiebout. Many may not have read Bill Fischel’s book, [The Homevoter Hypothesis](https://www.amazon.com/The-Homevoter-Hypothesis-Influence-Government/dp/0674015959/), but Bill seems to have figured it out from the source (the emphasis is mine).

> I have written for years about the Tiebout model and occasionally wondered what the author of the idea was like and how he came up with it. Tiebout died in 1968. When I was in Seattle in 1998, Dick Morrill, a retired geography professor, mentioned that Tienbout had spent the last six years of his fourteen-year academic career at the University of Washington. In the autumn of 1999, I contacted several of his friends and colleagues and talked with his son, Bruce Tiebout, to obtain some facts about his life. (**Bruce confirmed that the family name is pronounced Tee-bow, the latter syllable rhyming with the bow of the arrows and cellos**.)

The most popular way I have heard the name pronounced (Tee-boo) is incorrect. We owe it to a scholar of Tiebout’s influence to at least get his name right.
