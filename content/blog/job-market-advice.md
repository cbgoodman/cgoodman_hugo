In three parts about establishing your web presence.
<!--more-->
## 1. Assumptions
- JMP is fine
- Discussed market strategy with advisor
- Thought about what you want out of the job market

## 2. Website
- Important because people will google you and you should control that narrative
- Many potential options
  - Wordpress
  - Github
    - [Jekyll](https://pages.github.com/)
    - [Hugo]()
- Domain name is super important, IMO. Lends legitimacy, also cheap, investment in the future where you might want to control your own domain name.
- Why do this if your university offers web hosting?
  - You might want to move and probably will at some point
  - Setting up a website is a little time consuming; better to do it once
  - University hosting is often a bit limited and/or tedious. Doing it on your own gives you flexibility

## 3. Twitter
- An easy way to project your "brand"
- Get involved in academic twitter. Join the debate(s)!

Having a deliberate strategy about your web presence is helpful. It allows you to control the narrative about how you will be perceived online. This is extremely helpful on the job market.
