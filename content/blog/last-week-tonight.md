Ever so often, I teach public finance to graduate students. I have found for many topics it helps to motivate them by providing some "real world" examples (sidenote: I hate that term). [Last Week Tonight with John Oliver](https://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver) provides many such examples, presented in a let's say unique way. He's gotten very close to cover nearly every topic I would want to cover. I have tried to lay them out in a coherent way. Enjoy!
